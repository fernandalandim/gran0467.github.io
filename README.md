# LandINC webportfolio - IMD MTM6201 - Responsive Web Design ll

## Creative Process

The goal was to create my own website to showcase my skills and work experience. I did my best to keep it simple and with a nice and fluid layout that could be noticed when resizing the viewport.

Overall I had a lot of fun putting both my designer and programmer minds to work together. My professional goal is to be a Designer and I believe that to reach this outcome I need to understand what's possible and what isn't when designing a layout.

## Challenges

As I stated before I needed to know what was tangible while designing a layout. While I was sketching my "programming wireframes" (it's how I call the process where I need to think about adding grid or flex to my actual wireframes) I noticed that part of my content wouldn't work the way I had designed them. I had to reorganize the content on my webportfolio to avoid creating several ```divs``` with multiple classes on my HTML and consequently on my CSS.

**Masterhead banner:**

I have to admit that this banner took me a lot of time to figure out how to do it. I knew that it was possible to do it using CSS and I since this whole process was a learning process I decided to give it a try. To crop the images with a polygon shape I used the ```clip-path```. For instance: ```clip-path: polygon(0 0, 110% 0%, 75% 100%, 0% 100%);```

**Hiding contents:**

I used ```display: none;``` several times in order to hide some parts of my content on different viewports. The masterhead banner that I mentioned on the previous topic was one of the contents that I had to hide on the mobile version of my website.

**Libraries and Frameworks**

I knew I wasn't going to use Bootstrap for this task, but I considered the possibility of using SASS. It really seemed to be a solution but I chose to stick with the *vanilla CSS* to avoid wasting much time in this final run because I had other assignments to do as well. But I will definitely study SASS again and try to apply it on a personal project in the future.

## Accessibility
It's always important to make your website accessible to everyone. In my personal experience tutoring a student who is visual impaired  I could realize the importance of adding ```alt``` tags to images. My peer depends on his devices' audio-description feature to navigate online or to use the apps on his phone and tablet.

## Next steps

I mentioned a *personal project in the future*, well as soon as this term is over I will team up with a friend from Algonquin College and we will build from scratch the website for our **Photography Club** (which was already approved by the Clubs and Communities Department). I will take care of the design and the front-end, and my partner will take care of our database. I think it will be a good way to keep ourselves busy during this social distancing period, and apply everything that we had learned through this semester.
